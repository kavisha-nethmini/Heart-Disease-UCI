# Heart Disease Prediction:  Analyzing UCI Heart Disease Dataset

![Jupyter Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Notebook-orange)

## Overview

This repository contains a data science project completed as part of the training course on data science with Python at the University of Colombo School of Computing. The project focuses on predicting heart disease based on the UCI Heart Disease dataset and aims to provide practical experience in applying data science concepts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Heart-Disease-UCI Dataset](https://github.com/kavisha-nethmini/Heart-Disease-UCI/blob/main/heart_disease_uci.csv), which contains various attributes related to heart health. The dataset is preprocessed and explored to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.

## Project Structure

- `Heart-Disease-UCI.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- `heart_disease_uci.csv`: Directory containing the dataset files.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and patterns to gain insights into the dataset.
3. **Model Development**: Building machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for heart disease prediction.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. **Dataset**: To replicate or extend the analysis conducted in this project, you'll need to obtain the [Heart-Disease-UCI Dataset](https://github.com/kavisha-nethmini/Heart-Disease-UCI/blob/main/heart_disease_uci.csv).

- Download the dataset file from the provided link.
- Place the downloaded CSV file (`heart_disease_uci.csv`) in the same directory as the `Heart-Disease-UCI.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

3. Open and run the `Heart-Disease-UCI.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible platform.

With the dataset in place, you'll be able to run the notebook and perform the analysis on your local environment.
